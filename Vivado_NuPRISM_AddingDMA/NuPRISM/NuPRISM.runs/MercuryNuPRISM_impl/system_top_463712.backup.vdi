Phase 4 Post Placement Optimization and Clean-Up

Phase 4.1 Post Commit Optimization
INFO: [Timing 38-35] Done setting XDC timing constraints.
CRITICAL WARNING: [Timing 38-321] Multiple clocks arrive at pins Ad9229Core_b65/Ad9229Deserializer_INST/U_ISERDESE3/CLK and Ad9229Core_b65/Ad9229Deserializer_INST/U_ISERDESE3/CLKDIV. A single clock must arrive at pin Ad9229Core_b65/Ad9229Deserializer_INST/U_ISERDESE3/CLK and it must have the same master clock as a single clock arriving at pin Ad9229Core_b65/Ad9229Deserializer_INST/U_ISERDESE3/CLKDIV, with the latter only being phase shifted by 0/90/180/270 degrees. Any auto-derived clock on pin Ad9229Core_b65/Ad9229Deserializer_INST/U_ISERDESE3/RX_DIV2_CLK_Q will be created with 0 phase.
Resolution: Check the design and constraints to ensure that a single clock arrives at each of the two named pins, the two clocks have the same master clock, and the 0/90/180/270 degree phase shift requirement is met.
