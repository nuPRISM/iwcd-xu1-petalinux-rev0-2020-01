LVDS-1#1 Warning
Bidirection LVDS IOs  
The following port(s) use the LVDS I/O standard and have bi-directional differential usage. Please note that LVDS is a fixed impedance structure optimized to 100ohm differential. This is only intended to be used in point-to-point transmissions that do not have turn around timing requirements. If the intended usage is a bus structure, please use BLVDS/BLVDS_25, instead. ADC0_DA0_n, ADC0_DA0_p, ADC0_DA1_n, ADC0_DA1_p, ADC0_DB0_n, ADC0_DB0_p,
ADC0_DB1_n, ADC0_DB1_p, ADC0_DC0_n, ADC0_DC0_p, ADC0_DC1_n, ADC0_DC1_p,
ADC0_DD0_n, ADC0_DD0_p, ADC0_DD1_n (the first 15 of 78 listed).

REQP-1852#1 Warning
BUFGCE_cascade_from_clock_buf  
Cascaded clock buffers exist in the design with constant CE pin. This may result in large clock skew and timing violations. Cell BUFGCE Ad9229Core_b64/U_serClk I pin is driven by another clock buffer serdes_clock_b64/inst/clkout1_buf.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1852#2 Warning
BUFGCE_cascade_from_clock_buf  
Cascaded clock buffers exist in the design with constant CE pin. This may result in large clock skew and timing violations. Cell BUFGCE Ad9229Core_b65/U_serClk I pin is driven by another clock buffer serdes_clock_b65/inst/clkout2_buf.

REQP-1935#1 Advisory
RAMB36E2_nochange_collision_advisory  
Synchronous clocking is detected for BRAM (MercuryXU1_i/MercuryXU1_i/axi_dma_0/U0/I_PRMRY_DATAMOVER/GEN_S2MM_FULL.I_S2MM_FULL_WRAPPER/GEN_ENABLE_INDET_BTT_SF.I_INDET_BTT/I_DATA_FIFO/BLK_MEM.I_SYNC_FIFOGEN_FIFO/xpm_fifo_instance.xpm_fifo_sync_inst/xpm_fifo_base_inst/gen_sdpram.xpm_memory_base_inst/gen_wr_a.gen_word_narrow.mem_reg) in SDP mode with NO_CHANGE write-mode. This is the preferred mode for best power characteristics. However, NO_CHANGE may exhibit address collisions if the same address appears on both read and write ports resulting in unknown or corrupted read data. It is suggested to confirm via simulation that an address collision never occurs and if so it is suggested to try and avoid this situation. If address collisions cannot be avoided, the write-mode may be set to READ_FIRST which guarantees that the read data is the prior contents of the memory at the cost of additional power in the design. See the FPGA Memory Resources User Guide for additional information.
